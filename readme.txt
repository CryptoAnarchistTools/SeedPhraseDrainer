🔥 Two Simple Malware Examples 🔥

I'll cover persistence & AV evasion in future videos. 🛡️

The first is a VBS script that runs PowerShell with a bypass. ⚡

✅ No admin rights needed
✅ No CMD window pops up

You can customize how it looks—I’ll explain next. 🎭

🚀 Running the Malware
🕵️‍♂️ license, privacy, and config files? Just for social engineering!

📂 The real malware is inside dependencies.
🛑 VBS runs PowerShell hidden and kills duplicates to avoid multiple processes.
📋 PowerShell grabs the clipboard & saves it to Temp.
💡 Ask GROK AI to send SEEDPHRASE it via Discord or Telegram.

🛠️ Want to Spread This?
🔐 Encrypt it to bypass static scans.
🔄 Add registry persistence (HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run).
🕶️ Sleep before start to broken sandboxes to avoid AV traps.

⚡ Every Malware Should Be Unique!
This is your base—or you can "borrow" one. 😏😂

🎯 To spread it widely, be smart & creative.

⚠️ Use wisely. ⚠️
